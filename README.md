### More About Me

I started my journey into the tech world a few years ago and have been fascinated by the potential of blockchain technology ever since. The idea of a decentralized internet and the transparency it offers is what drives my passion. I believe that open source is the future of technology, fostering collaboration and innovation.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about the latest trends in blockchain, participating in online communities, and contributing to open source projects. I find that these activities not only help me stay updated but also allow me to give back to the community that has taught me so much.

### My Goals

- **Master Open Source Development:** Continue to learn and contribute to significant open source projects.
- **Blockchain Innovation:** Work on projects that push the boundaries of what blockchain can do, focusing on practical applications that can make a difference.
- **Community Building:** Engage more with the tech community, both online and offline, to share knowledge and collaborate on exciting projects.
